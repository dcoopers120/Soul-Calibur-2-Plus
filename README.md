Here Get the lastest update versions. Tools and etc.
Soul calibur 2 Plus Offers all 3 guest characters no longer exclusive to one of their respective consoles versions. Unfornetly they do not have the correct Models at the moment. But not to worry my full team is working on it hard everyday.
This version is avabile on ps2, original xbox, and Gamecube. This also works on emulation. If you do this on console it gotta be modded.

Other Features we offer are Addtional costumes skins for the characters. (ps2 doesn't have any yet)
Custom Voices 
Stage Textures and Many More.
The Gamecube Version Has the most features at the moment. With Weapon Master randomize. which randomizes some of the dugeon stages. Along with addtional character slot siegfried with some of his soul calibur 1 moves and his sc3 english voice. by crispin freeman. so you can play nightmare vs siegfried.
We also offer netplay via dolphin emulation and pcsx2. but you can also use parsec.
